Created by Dharak Vasavda (d_vasavda@u.pacific.edu) and Nathan Luu (n_luu1@u.pacific.edu)


Aggregating multiple job hunting websites into one. Taking job hunting websites such as LinkedIn and Indeed.com, and placing it into one universal search engine.

This project will use:

- MSSQL Server as the database storage for job information
- Python will interact with the APIs on the job hunting website to gather the right data
