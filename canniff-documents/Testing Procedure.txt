Tests are located in the file test_results.xlsx

The test results are divided into two components:
- Data scraping component
- React framework/end-user component

For the Python component, a script is written to automatically test whether all of the edge cases pass or not.
All that is needed is to run the python file and it will automatically call system commands with edge cases to see
whether or not they work.
