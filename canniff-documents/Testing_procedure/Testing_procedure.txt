This file contains documentation for how tests were completed in the project


Tests are located in the file test_results.xlsx

The tests are divided into two components:
- Data scraping component
- React framework/end-user component

For the Python component, a script is written to automatically test whether all of the edge cases pass or not.
All that is needed is to run the python file and it will automatically call system commands with edge cases to see
whether or not they work. The script is scraping_tests.py


For the React component, the website only takes input from the CSV files so the CSV cannot be read the website
will not display anything and report to the user that the website could not have been scraped.
